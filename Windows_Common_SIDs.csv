SECURITY_NETWORK_RID,S-1-5-2,Users who log on across a network. This is a group identifier added to the token of a process when it was logged on across a network. The corresponding logon type is LOGON32_LOGON_NETWORK.
SECURITY_BATCH_RID,S-1-5-3,Users who log on using a batch queue facility. This is a group identifier added to the token of a process when it was logged as a batch job. The corresponding logon type is LOGON32_LOGON_BATCH.

The X and Y values for these SIDs are different for each logon session. The value SECURITY_LOGON_IDS_RID_COUNT is the number of RIDs in this identifier (5-X-Y).

The PRINCIPAL_SELF SID is useful for specifying an inheritable ACE that applies to the user or group object that inherits the ACE. It the only way of representing the SID of a created object in the default security descriptor of the schema.
